Paragraph Text Document (.ptd) File Format Specification
Version: 1.0 alpha (Draft 070225_001)

This document outlines the specification for the Paragraph Text Document (.ptd) file format,
designed for use with the Paragraph text editor application.

A .ptd file is a ZIP archive containing the following internal components:

1.  meta.info:  Stores metadata about the document in JSON format.
2.  document.xml: Stores the main document content and formatting in XML format.

---

1.  meta.info (Metadata File)

	Format: JSON.

	Purpose:  Contains descriptive metadata about the Paragraph Text Document.
				This information is intended for document management, versioning, and application-specific settings.

	Required Fields:

		- documentTitle (String):
			The user-defined title of the document. Example: "My Important Report".

		- ptdFormatVersion (Number):
			Version number of the .ptd file format specification.  Example: 1.0.
			This field ensures compatibility and versioning control across different application versions.

		- ptdTypeVersion (String):
			Indicates the development or release stage of the Paragraph application version that created this document.
			Examples: "alpha", "beta", "stable".

	Optional Fields (to be considered for future versions):

		- author (String):
			Name of the document author.

		- creationDate (String):
			Date and time when the document was initially created.

		- modificationDate (String):
			Date and time of the last document modification (save operation).

		- documentVersion (Integer):
			Counter that increments each time the document is loaded into the Paragraph editor and subsequently saved.
			This tracks the number of "editing sessions" rather than every single save operation.
			The counter should increment by one upon each load-and-save cycle.
			Example:  Starts at 1 for a new document. Increments to 2 after the first load and save, then to 3 after the next load and save, and so on.

	Example JSON structure for meta.info:

	```json
	{
		"documentTitle": "My Presentation File",
		"ptdFormatVersion": 3.2,
		"ptdTypeVersion": "stable",
		"author": "Hppsrc",
		"creationDate": "2025-02-07 09:00:00",
		"modificationDate": "2025-02-07 17:00:00",
		"documentVersion": 3
	}
	```

2.  document.xml (Document Content File)

	Format: XML.

	Purpose: Contains the primary content of the Paragraph Text Document, including:
				- Textual content itself.
				- Text formatting (e.g., bold, italics, font styles, sizes, colors).
				- Document structure (e.g., paragraphs, headings, lists).
				- Potentially, in future versions, references to embedded media.

	Structure and Tags:
		The detailed XML schema for document.xml will be defined in a separate, more detailed specification document.
		However, it is envisioned to use a structured XML format that allows for:

		- Semantic markup of document elements (e.g., <paragraph>, <heading level="1">, <list type="bulleted">).
		- Attribute-based styling for text formatting (e.g., <bold>, <italic>, <font family="Arial" size="12pt">).
		- Clear separation of content and presentation/style.

	Example (Illustrative - Simplified XML structure for document.xml):

	```xml
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<document>
		<metadata>
			<formatVersion>1.0</formatVersion> <!- Format version of document.xml structure ->
		</metadata>
		<body>
			<paragraph style="normal">
				This is the first <bold>paragraph</bold> of the document.
			</paragraph>
			<paragraph style="normal">
				Here is another paragraph with <italic>italicized</italic> text.
			</paragraph>
			<heading level="2">Section Title</heading>
			<list type="bulleted">
				<item>First bullet point</item>
				<item>Second bullet point</item>
			</list>
		</body>
	</document>
	```
